Code Beats Unleashed
[Verse]
Lines of logic racing through my head
Binary whispers
What’s left unsaid
Electric sparks
My heart’s on fire
Every keystroke builds my empire

[Chorus]
Code beats unleashed
Feel the rush
Feel the glow
AI spins the music
Let the rhythm flow
We’re the architects of sound
Let the circuits sing
Euphoria rising
This is everything

[Verse 2]
Loops and layers
A symphony of math
Chasing bugs down the endless path
From chaos comes this perfect sound
In the code
I’ve finally found

[Prechorus]
Ones and zeroes dance in time
Infinite worlds in every line

[Chorus]
Code beats unleashed
Feel the rush
Feel the glow
AI spins the music
Let the rhythm flow
We’re the architects of sound
Let the circuits sing
Euphoria rising
This is everything

[Bridge]
Every crash
Every fail
Every sleepless night
Led to this
The dawn of digital light
A melody born from the void we create
This is the moment we dominate fate
